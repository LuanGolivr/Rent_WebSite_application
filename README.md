# Scalable_System
#################################################################
The Goal of this application is to build an entire scalable system, I'm already developing it but the repository that I was originally coding was private so I decided to create a public one.
Ok so , by all means when I referer to scalable system I mean that I'm going to try to implement the maximum as possible, that includes queues for batching the requests for increases the speed, a caching system to decrease the work that must be done to get the data from the database and increase the speed of responses, I'm not so sure but for now but maybe I'm going to implement LFU cache, in order to scale the database I'm try to implement replication single-based or multileader I haven't decided yet let see, and other things like load balancer etc etc etc etc To many concepts.
I will updated this readme when necessary.
